# aaRon

A collection of R functions I use day-to-day in analysing various next-generation sequencing data, in particular whole genome bisulfite sequencing.

# Installation

To get the current development version from github:

```R

# TODOs

* Create S4 classes for methylation count and ratio tables
* Add working examples to each function
* Create additional vignettes of example use cases
