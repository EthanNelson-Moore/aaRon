# aaRon

A collection of R functions I use day-to-day in analysing various next-generation sequencing data, in particular whole genome bisulfite sequencing.

# Installation

To get the current development version from github:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("astatham/aaRon")

# TODOs

* Document each function (thank you roxygen2!) and add working examples
